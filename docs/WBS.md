## Dependencies and Critical Path

The critical path for this project follows:
1. Phase-2 (Repository setup)
2. Phase-3 (Core Infrastructure)
3. Phase-4/5 (BOT Implementations) - can be parallelized
4. Phase-6 (Multi-BOT Orchestration)
5. Phase-7 (Deployment & CI/CD)
6. Phase-8 (Operational Testing)

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Saxo API changes | High | Medium | Implement version detection and fallback mechanisms |
| Rate limit exceeded | High | Medium | Implement proper throttling and backoff strategies |
| Slippage exceeds thresholds | Medium | Medium | Implement Slippage Guard with proper monitoring |
| Model drift | Medium | High | Regular retraining and monitoring of feature drift |
| Infrastructure failure | High | Low | Implement redundancy and proper monitoring |
